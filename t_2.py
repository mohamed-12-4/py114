Seema is 21 years old. For each even birthday (2nd, 4th, 6th â€¦.20) she receives money. For her
second birthday, she receives 10 USD, and the sum increases by 10 USD with each following odd birthday
(3rd -> 10, 5th-> 20, 7th-> 30, etc.). Seema has secretly been saving the money for 21 years. On her 21st
birthday, she wants to buy a washing machine for 150 USD. Write a program that calculates how much
money she has saved and whether it is enough to buy a washing machine.
